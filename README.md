# Portfolio

This was my personal website that I used to use as a digital portfolio to showcase some of my projects and skills as a web developer. It contained examples of my most recent work, as well as information about my technical skills. Originally developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the project was migrated to React. You can visit the updated repository ([Portfolio-React](https://github.com/mrgiann/React-Portfolio)).
